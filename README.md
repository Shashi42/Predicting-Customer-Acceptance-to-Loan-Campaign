# Predicting-Customer-Acceptance-to-Loan-Campaign

## Final Project for CSCE 5215 Machine Learning | UNT Spring 2024

## Introduction
Customer's sentiment towards products always play a major role in real-world sales, This project comes out interesting as it deals with different machine learning techniques such as regression and classification in order to solve a practical problem. 
<br><br>
Most particularly this will help us understand the patterns in customer behavior which in turn helps the banks to market better loan products that are most likely preferred by their customers!

### Example:

To illustrate the example for the process of predicting customer responses to personal loan campaigns, let's consider a scenario. A bank is launching a new personal loan campaign and wants to target customers who are most likely to respond positively to the offer. The bank has a dataset of previous customers and their responses to similar campaigns. Using this data, the bank can train a machine learning model to predict which customers are most likely to respond positively to the new campaign.

## Project Workflow:

1. Data Collection and Preparation

   This dataset was collected by Thera Bank and their customer’s response to a Personal Loan Marketing Campaign run. The bank was looking to convert their liability customers into personal loan customers. By understanding their own customer’s demographic, they are able to spend more resources on customers who are more likely to accept a personal loan. The results of this campaign showed that there was only a 9% success rate in converting their customers to accept a personal loan. As a result, this motivated the marketing department to come up with better campaigns and to increase the success rate by operating within a tight budget.
 <br><br>
 The dataset itself contains about 5000 customer’s information across 14 columns, including their basic details such as Age, Income and also collecting the information on their mortgage and credit card usage. The last column “Personal Loan” denotes whether the customer accepted the loan or not.

   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Data preprocessing

   


4. Model Building and Evaluation


### 1. Data Collection and Preparation
